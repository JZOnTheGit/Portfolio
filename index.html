        <p class="project-description">This project was started by a user request on "TikTok", it tests my ability to work with binary code and how it can be manipulated to obtain specific data. <br><br> The project works by getting the needed didgits from the "TikTok" URL. <br> Converting them to binary, getting the first 32 didgits of that binary number then converting back to denary. <br> finally converting that denary value to the UNIX Time Code to obtain the exact date the video was uploaded.<br><br> Finally puttting all that into the JavaScript into the website and linking it with the html button then finishing with the css.<br><br> The project can be viewed from the link below, along with the source code on my Github <br><br> <a href="https://tiktok-video-date-finder.onrender.com" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;">Project Link</a> / / / <a href="https://github.com/JZOnTheGit/TikTokVideoDate" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;">Source Code</a> </p>
