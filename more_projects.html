            <p class="project-description">This project was started by a user request on "TikTok", it tests my ability to work with binary code and how it can be manipulated to obtain specific data. <br><br> The project works by getting the needed didgits from the "TikTok" URL. <br> Converting them to binary, getting the first 32 didgits of that binary number then converting back to denary. <br> finally converting that denary value to the UNIX Time Code to obtain the exact date the video was uploaded.<br><br> Finally puttting all that into the JavaScript into the website and linking it with the html button then finishing with the css.<br><br> The project can be viewed from the link below, along with the source code on my Github. <br><br> <a href="https://ttudf.j-singh.net" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;">Project Link</a> / / / <a href="https://github.com/JZOnTheGit/TikTokVideoDate" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;">Source Code</a> </p>

            <p class="project-description">This project was made in 2021 when i was learning how to develop games in the Unity Game Engine. <br><br> This project uses a movement system, grappling system, and a simple UI interface that creates a parkour game where the user jumps through platforms, grapples and completes multiple levels. <br><br> It was created using scripts within unity that were using the C# language. <br> I also was able to integrate daabases and remote features from 3rd party systems like Firebase.<br><br> The game can be downloaded below.<br><br> <a href="https://d3v1l.itch.io/ninja-parkour" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;">Project Link</a> </p>

            <p class="project-description">I have created multiple 2D mobile games available for the google play store, however over the course of few years, I havent updated any of the games and lost the source code, therefore losing access to the account. <br><br>One of the games were a simple drag the bottom slider to move the space ship left or right to dodge the obstacles, this was created in a low-code game engine called Buildbox. <br>Another were a infinite horizontal scroller where you tap to make your player jump and dodge obstacles, this was also created on Buildbox.<br> <br>The third game was when I moved to Unity and made a 3D multi-level game where the player walks around the arena eliminating Robots to end up getting to the last level and defeating the final boss.<br>This game was my first 3D game and also included an open world driving simulator. <br><br> I have lost the source code, however I have an OLD WEBSITE that includes my past mobile games. <br>This site was made in 2020 on a website template, before I focused on building my own sites from code<br><br>LINKS IN SITE MIGHT NOT WORK DUE TO OLD RESOURCES <br><br> WEBSITE HAS BEEN MODIFIED TO REMOVE OLD BRANDING AND FIX ISSUES (Might be missing elements)<br><br> <a href="https://teamghost.webador.co.uk" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;">OLD WEBSITE WITH GAME DETAILS</a>  </p>

            <p class="project-description">I have programmed an Windows application using Visual Studio that included a simple compact GUI, where the User can activate the Client, incert the LUA script and inject it into the Roblox Client <br><br>(All exploiting goes againt Roblox ToS)<br><br>This application included an activation key, that resets every certain time limit, where the user goes through a link with Ads to get the new key. <br>(This allowed me to monitize and earn Ad revenue)<br><br>The user then injects the API into the Game Client, Inputs the LUA script, then runs the script.<br><br>This gave me experience in reverse engineering and explointing applications to find vulnerabilities, which then can be reported to the company for them to fix. (Exploit is now patched) <br><br>SOURCE CODE AND PROJECT LINK ARE BEING FOUND, SINCE THE PROJECT IS OLD AND IS ON A PREIVIOUSLY OWNED COMPUTER.<br><br> <a href="#" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;">Coming Soon</a>  </p>
